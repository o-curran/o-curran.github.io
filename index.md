Hello! My name is Odhrán, pronounced /ˈɔːɹ.ɪn/. I study computer science & linguistics at Trinity College, Dublin, where I've recently finished first year.

Right now, I'm working under Prof. Nathan W. Hill at the Trinity Centre for Asian Studies on finite-state transducers for historical phonology. Aside from my studies, I'm a committee member of the College Historical Society, the world's oldest student debating society, for its 256th session.

You can find projects I've worked on [here](projects.html), or other assorted miscellany [here](misc.html).

Feel free to reach out! Get in touch at [oscurran(at)gmail(dot)com](mailto:oscurran@gmail.com) or [curranod(at)tcd(dot)ie](mailto:curranod@tcd.ie).
